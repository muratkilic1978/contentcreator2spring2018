<p>TLA Accounting Services Inc., has been in operation since June of 1990. We specialize in providing comprehensive financial services such as bookkeeping, payroll, tax consultation and the preparation of financial statements. Whether it is a small or large firm, we provide complete business administration solutions ranging from basic book keeping, payroll compliance, tax compliance issues, cost analysis, and business planning.

We are pleased to have worked with companies in a vast range of industries including: hospitality, manufacturing, entertainment, construction, transportation, private education, financial services, retail, and internet based services. Additionally, our work has included contract CFO positions for rapidly expanding private companies, assisting them through their transition from a small one man operation through to the IPO. A common thread through these diverse business sectors is the client's need for a steady, long term relationship with their financial advisor.

We are confident that if you are looking for a driven partner with innovative solutions for your business you have come to the right place. No one of us is as good as all of us. </p>
